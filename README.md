# python-challenge
In PyBank and PyPoll respectively, the analysis folders contain the results.txt files which should output the results correctly. 
The resources folders have the .csv files that contain the raw data used to produce the outputs. 
The main.py contain my code which call the .csv files and translate that information to the analysis files. 
Nothing was copy-pasted from elsewhere, though I should credit certain sources of help: 
Eli and Mark helped me to understand what the assignment was asking for, as the instructions in PyBank were slightly vague for me. 
Eli advised me to consider that the 'change' starts with the second entry, not the first. 
The following link, https://www.pythontutorial.net/python-basics/python-write-text-file/, helped me learn to write to a txt file. 
I am doing this assignment in advance and we had not covered that, but the aforementioned link helped me.

Thank you for grading my assignment!
